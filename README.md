# Travel_App
Tourism Management Application using Flutter Tkinder 
Transportation Route Management System
This project is a Python-based GUI application designed to efficiently manage transportation routes and their associated details. Built using Tkinter for the user interface and SQLite for data storage, the application provides a seamless way to record, view, search, and manage transportation data.

Key Features:
Add New Routes: Easily add transportation routes by entering details such as the source, destination, distance, and cost.
View All Routes: A tabular display of all recorded routes, including their source, destination, distance (in kilometers), and cost.
Search Functionality: Quickly search for routes by entering a keyword (source or destination) to filter the results.
Delete Routes: Select and delete any route from the database.
Refresh Data: Instantly reload and refresh the table to display updated route information.
Database Integration: All data is stored persistently using SQLite, ensuring that information is retained between sessions.
How It Works:
Adding a Route: Click on the "Add Route" button to open a new window where you can input the source, destination, distance, and cost. After entering the details, the route is saved to the SQLite database.
Viewing Routes: All routes are displayed in a scrollable table, making it easy to review or manage them.
Searching Routes: Enter a keyword in the search bar to filter routes based on the source or destination.
Deleting a Route: Select a route from the table and click "Delete Route" to remove it from the database.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
SQLite: For managing the applicationâ€™s database.
Pillow (optional): If you wish to extend the application for further GUI enhancements.
Screenshots:
Main Interface: Displays all transportation routes in a table with options to add, delete, and search.
Add Route Window: A form to input details for a new route.
Search Results: Filtered routes based on a user-provided keyword.
Future Enhancements:
Add export functionality (e.g., exporting routes as CSV or Excel files).
Implement user authentication for secure access.
Integrate additional metrics such as travel time and fuel efficiency.
Expand to include different transport modes or schedules.
